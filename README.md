> Short blurb about what your product does.
This web application created to encourage user to have an easier time tracking their caloric intake for diet. After signing up, the user is allowed to set a goal and add the type of food they ate to track their total daily calories.

This project was made using Javascript,CSS,HTML, libraries/framework such as express and mongoose. To let users search for the types of food and get back accurate information on nutrition values, we used an external API which request data from USDA(United States Department of Agriculture) food composition databases. We included front-end data validation, back-end data validation, external API, and authentication. The user is able to add and delete the food from their profile. For editing, the user is able to edit their goal for the calories consumption when they are logged in.
