# bonApetite
> This web application was created to encourage users to have an easier time tracking their calorie intake for their dieting plan. After signing up and logging in, the user is allowed to set a goal and add/delete the type of food they ate to track their total daily calories.

Our project was made using Javascript,CSS,HTML, libraries/framework such as express and mongoose. To let users search for the types of food and get back accurate information on nutrition values, we used an external API which request data from USDA(United States Department of Agriculture) food composition databases. We included front-end data validation, back-end data validation, external API, and authentication. The user is able to add and delete the food from their profile. For editing, the user is able to edit their goal for the calories consumption when they are logged in.
